sudo certbot -d domain.com,www.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly

then add the txt record in dns

you may have to change permission for privkey to 644

goto virtualmin, update certificate & key and done.

manual renewal though. 

for auto renew: 
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.
